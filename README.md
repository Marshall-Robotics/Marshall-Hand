# Hand-kinesis
## About
Kinesis,from the Ancient Greek *κίνησις* (*kínēsis*, “motion, movement”)(wikipedia). The objective of this project is to make a device that mirrors your hand's movements 

## Status
The alpha stage is complete; the hand can acurately mimic imput from an analog device with little latency. 
Beta stage starting soon (where I make a glove that you put on)

## Credits
Hand design inspired by 
Code, electronics and wiring: Felipe Galindo
